# 🪙 Proof of Funds MVP

**Author:** [@vicdevmanx](https://x.com/vicdevman)  
**Type:** Web3 Verification Utility  
**Version:** MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

## 📘 Overview

**Proof of Funds (PoF) MVP** is a Web3 application that allows users to **verify and prove ownership of funds** in their crypto wallets — securely, transparently, and without exposing private information.

It provides a trusted way for individuals, investors, tenants, and organizations to **demonstrate financial capacity**, enabling more secure and trustworthy interactions both **on-chain and off-chain**.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

In Web3 — and even traditional finance — **trust is fragile**.  
People often claim to have funds, but without a verifiable method of proof, those claims are hard to believe.

Traditional verification systems are:
- Centralized and slow,  
- Require unnecessary personal data,  
- Not designed for crypto wallets or decentralized identities.  

**Proof of Funds MVP** fixes this by creating a **decentralized verification layer** that allows wallets to prove their balance — without revealing private data or needing a third party.

## 🎯 Project Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| ✅ **Verification** | Allow users to generate proof that their wallet holds a specified amount of funds. |
| ✅ **Transparency** | Let others verify the proof easily. |
| ✅ **Privacy** | Ensure no private keys or sensitive details are ever exposed. |
| ✅ **Simplicity** | Keep the experience fast and beginner-friendly. |
| ✅ **Expandability** | Build a base for future integrations and blockchain utilities. |

## 👥 Target Users

| User Type | Use Case |
|------------|-----------|
| **Investors / Contributors** | Prove they have sufficient funds to join a project or sale. |
| **Landlords / Tenants** | Verify financial capacity when applying for rentals — landlords can use this system to confirm that a tenant’s portfolio or “funds proof” is legitimate, reducing fraud and improving trust. |
| **Project Teams** | Verify if users or backers meet funding requirements. |
| **Web3 Platforms** | Integrate the verification step to improve user credibility. |
| **Developers** | Experiment and extend the concept for their own apps. |

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **Connect Wallet**
The user connects a crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet).  
The system reads only public balance data — never private keys.

### 2. **Verify Balance**
It checks if the wallet meets a specific threshold (e.g., has at least 1 ETH).

### 3. **Generate Proof**
A digital “Proof of Funds Certificate” is created, showing that the wallet held a certain amount at a specific time.

### 4. **Share Proof**
Users can share this proof with others — landlords, project teams, or anyone needing verification.

### 5. **Verify Proof**
Anyone can validate the proof independently through the app interface.

## 🔐 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Transparency** | Proofs can be verified independently by anyone. |
| **Privacy First** | No personal or private wallet details are shared. |
| **Decentralization** | Built on blockchain data, not central databases. |
| **User Ownership** | Users control their proofs and decide when to share them. |
| **Integrity** | Every proof includes a timestamp and verifiable data. |

## 🧭 Example Use Cases

### 💰 Investor Verification  
Before joining a token sale or startup round, a user proves they have sufficient funds in their wallet.

### 🏠 Tenant–Landlord Verification  
When applying for an apartment, a tenant can show proof of their wallet balance instead of traditional financial documents.  
The landlord can verify the proof directly — no banks, no screenshots, just blockchain-backed trust.

### 🪙 DAO Membership  
DAO communities can require members to prove they hold a certain number of governance tokens.

### 🎓 Web3 Grants or Scholarships  
Applicants can verify they meet staking or fund requirements to qualify for support.
